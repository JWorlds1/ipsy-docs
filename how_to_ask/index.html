&mdash; Joseph Campbell</blockquote>
<p>Before you ask someone for help, be sure that you have done the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If there's an error message: read it closely. Though sometimes unclear, all
contain information that can help you to understand what's happening.</li>
<li>Think about the task you're trying to perform, and as many of the
behind-the-scenes steps involved as you can. Consider how the error
fits into that stack. <em>Which</em> part of the system is throwing the error: your
script, another command, the language, the file system, the network?</li>
<li>If the error message isn't immediately helpful, search for it using a search
engine.</li>
<li>Read the documentation and/or man page. Perhaps what you think you're doing is
not <em>actually</em> what the command is doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have considered the above, and both your insight and search engine skills
are failing you, then it's likely time to ask someone else for help.</p>
<p>When asking someone for help, be sure to provide them with the following
information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>clearly describe what you're trying to do</li>
<li>provide the error message (if any)</li>
<li>explain what you've already done to fix/understand this problem</li>
</ul>
<p>A good rule is that the amount of effort you put into understanding/solving a
problem is the maximum effort that the other person will invest. To apply this
rule to a common situation: if your description is that "it doesn't work", you
should fully expect no response &mdash; as their response-effort precisely matches the
effort you've invested into explaining your problem.</p>
<p>When you find a solution to your problem, make sure that you are engaged with it
&mdash; and understand it. The goal is not to just fix the immediate issue, but rather
to build a body of knowledge and develop the broader skill of troubleshooting.
Computers should be tools which empower you &mdash; rather than something inflicted
upon you.</p>
