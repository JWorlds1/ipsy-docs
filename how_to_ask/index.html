&mdash; Joseph Campbell</blockquote>
<p>Before you ask someone for help, be sure that you have done the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If there's an error message: read it. Though sometimes cryptic, all contain
information that can help you to understand what's happening.</li>
<li>Think about the task you're trying to perform, and as many of the
behind-the-scenes steps and parts involved as possible. Consider how the error
fits into that stack. <em>Which</em> part of the system is throwing the error: your
script, another command, the language, the file system, the network?</li>
<li>If the error message isn't immediately helpful, search for it using a search
engine.</li>
<li>Read the documentation and/or man page. Perhaps what you think you're doing is
not <em>actually</em> what the command is doing.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have considered the above, and both your insight and search-foo are
failing you, then it's likely time to ask someone else for help.</p>
<p>When asking for help, be sure to provide the person the following information:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Clearly describe what you're trying to do</li>
<li>Provide the error message (if any)</li>
<li>Explain what steps you've already done to fix/understand this</li>
</ul>
<p>A good rule of thumb is that the amount of effort you put into
understanding/solving a problem is the maximum effort that the other
person will invest. Put more pointedly: if you use the phrase "it doesn't work",
you should fully expect no response &mdash; as their response-effort precisely matches
the effort you've invested into explaining your problem.</p>
<p>When you are met with the answer, make sure that you are engaged with it &mdash; and
understand it. The goal here is not just to fix your immediate problem. It's to
build a body of knowledge and the skill of troubleshooting. This all culminates
at the end-goal: computers should be tools which empower you &mdash; rather than
inflicted upon you.</p>
