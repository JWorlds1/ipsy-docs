<ul>
<li><p class="first">IPython won't start or complains that it "Failed to create history session".
The cause of this is known, but not entirely understood. The current
workaround is the disable history in IPython (don't worry, this won't delete
your history, just disable it temporarily). You can do so by launching IPython
as <tt class="docutils literal">ipython <span class="pre">--HistoryManager.hist_file=:memory:</span></tt></p>
<p>This... problem is triggered by an update to a completely unrelated package.
Understanding the connection between the two is still ongoing.</p>
<p>The upshot, is that the problem is fixed by a reboot. The hope is that once I
have a better understanding of the underlying problem, that a reboot can be
avoided. But, if this takes too long, then I will simply take advantage of the
slowdown around the holidays, and reboot the head node then.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">"Some" <tt class="docutils literal">.hdf5</tt> files remain locked after initial creation. The source of
this problem is elusive, and makes little sense.</p>
<p>The current work-around is to <tt class="docutils literal">cp</tt> the file and then <tt class="docutils literal">mv</tt> the copy over
the original. This forces the file to be assigned a new inode, which
invalidates the in-file locking. Madness.</p>

<dt>2018.08.31 - ZFS upgrade</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The data node's version of ZFS was upgraded to 0.7.9. This brings a wide range
of fixes.</p>
<p class="last">The cluster was rebooted for the update to take effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2018.08.02 - Wine 3.0.1 installed cluster-wide</dt>
<dd>If you really need to shoe-horn your Windows-based workflow onto our Debian
cluster, then there is a small ray of hope for you. If you can get your
application to run via Wine 3.0.x, you can now run it across the entire cluster.</dd>
<dt>2018.07.09 - Increased number of Matlab toolbox licenses</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The university has a new licensing agreement with Mathworks. In all
practicality, there are now an unlimited number of Matlab and toolbox licenses
(10,000).</p>
<p class="last">Thus, Matlab users on Condor no longer need to limit the number of compute
nodes used due to licensing constraints. The <a class="reference external" href="../medusa/condor/#matlab">Condor/Matlab documentation</a> has been updated to reflect this.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2018.07.09 - Fixed swap vs /tmp disk allocation on compute nodes</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Due to a bug in the installation's preseed configuration, compute nodes with
large hard drives were allocating the excess space to the swap partition
rather than the <tt class="docutils literal">/tmp</tt> directory. This has been fixed, and all nodes have
been reinstalled.</p>
<p class="last">It is now possible for jobs to run which need a large amount of local disk
space rather than NFS.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2018.07.06 - Updated nibabel, nipype, indexed-gzip, fsleyes</dt>
<dd>Updated version of these packages have been installed, which should finally
allow them all to coexist in fully updated harmony. Previously, many tools
were displaying warnings, and a downgraded version of nibabel was needed to
keep everything functional.</dd>
<dt>2018.06.13 - Signing Key for IPSY's Debian Repo Expired</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The signing key for IPSY repository of Debian packages on Kumo expired. It has
been updated and the updated key deployed to all cluster systems. If this is
affecting you on your local system, run the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal">curl <span class="pre">http://kumo.ovgu.de/debian/ipsy_apt.gpg.key</span> | sudo <span class="pre">apt-key</span> add -</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sudo <span class="pre">apt-get</span> update</tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal">sudo <span class="pre">apt-get</span> install <span class="pre">--only-upgrade</span> <span class="pre">ipsy-keyring</span></tt></li>
</ul>
<p class="last">If prompted about a conflicting <tt class="docutils literal">ipsy.gpg</tt> file, respond with <tt class="docutils literal">Y</tt>.</p>
</dd>
<dt>2018.04.11 - Condor jobs fail to start on snake4</dt>
<dd>When jobs attempted to run on snake4, they would bounce between running and
idle and complain in the logs about a "Shadow Exception". The cause was a
deeply mangled /etc/passwd file. The node has been reinstalled.</dd>
<dt>2018.04.05 - fsleyes crashes on start</dt>
<dd>An updated dependency of fsleyes caused it to crash. The bug was reported,
the upstream maintainer released a fix, and that fix has now been deployed.</dd>
<dt>2018.03.16 - DataLad Upgrade</dt>
<dd>DataLad was upgraded and moved from a system package to a singularity
container. Most users shouldn't notice a difference, but if you were using any
of its Python libraries directly, they are no longer installed system-wide.</dd>
<dt>2018.03.13 - HeuDiConv/Nipype Fixed</dt>
<dd>Nipype was failing (prematurely), complaining about an outdated version of
Pydot. Until the real fix is applied, an updated version of Pydot has been
backported, which seems to resolve the problem.</dd>
<dt>2018.03.11 - ZFS upgrade</dt>
<dd><p class="first">The data node's version of ZFS was upgraded to 0.7.6. This brings a wide range
of fixes, especially performance related. Hopefully this will end the elusive
"some files, take 1+ minute each to delete" problem.</p>
<p class="last">The cluster was rebooted for the update to take effect.</p>
