Wired Network
*************
Most network jacks are activated. If you need network access and the jack isn't
active, contact **Nico Marek** and he will ask for it to be enabled.

Wireless Network
****************
There are many WiFi networks available on campus. We recommend the following
networks:

``eduroam``
  Uses your OvGU email address and password to authenticate. Can be used at any
  institution participating in the `eduroam network <https://www.eduroam.org>`_.
``OvGU-802.1X``
  Uses your OvGU account. Is considered part of the OvGU network, and can access
  intranet resources.

VPN
***
VPN access allows you to remotely connect to resources that are only available
from within the OvGU network (such as licensing servers, journal access, etc).

* VPN Type: ``Cisco IPSec``
* host: ``vpn.ovgu.de``
* user: <your ovgu account> (same one to authenticate for email)
* password: <your password>
* group-name: ``vpn1``
* shared secret: ``vpn1``

In general, it is easiest to use your OS's built-in VPN support. However, Cisco
does provide a VPN client (Cisco AnyConnect), and the URZ provides
`detailed instructions <https://www.urz.ovgu.de/vpn-path-204,616.html>`_ on how
to configure it.
