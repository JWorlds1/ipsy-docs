Mattermost
*************
The faculty for computer science hosts a `mattermost instance <https://mm.cs.ovgu.de>`_ to which you can register and join an existing team.
For that a team admin has to invite you to it.
Team admins currently are: **Nico Marek**, **Peter Varvra** and **Manuela Kuhn**

Every team has two types of channels:

* public: everybody can join
* private: one can only join after an invitation of a channel member

By default every team has two public channels: "Off-Topic" and "Town Square".

In addition one-to-one-communication between people is also possible via "direct message".

A more detailed explanation on how to use mattermost can be found on `the official mattermost documentation <https://docs.mattermost.com/guides/user.html>`_.
