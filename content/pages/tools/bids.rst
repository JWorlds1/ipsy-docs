BIDS
####
:order: 520

The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) is a set of rules to organize and
describe the data from neuroimaging and behavioral experiments. Following this
practice makes it easier for scientists to work with each other's data, for both
collaborative and reproducible-science purposes. A standard data layout also
makes it easier to write analysis tools, and a growing number of tools (see
`BIDS Apps <http://bids-apps.neuroimaging.io>`_) require that input data be BIDS
formatted.

Do note that BIDS is under active development by the neuroimaging community.
BIDS extension proposals (BEPs) are central to the governance for BIDS, and BEPs
for other modalities and methods are continuously submitted, discussed, and
integrated.
