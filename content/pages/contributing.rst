Found a problem or have a suggestion for how these docs can be improved?
You can report it on the `issues tracker`_ on GitHub.

And... while bug reports are welcome, patches are *even more* welcome. ;-)

The git repository for this site is `hosted on GitHub`_. If you are not already
familiar with git and/or GitHub, read our `git documentation </tools/git/>`_
first.

Content is written in `reStructuredText`_ and the site is generated by
`Pelican`_. To setup the build environment:

* clone the repo from GitHub and pull submodules::

    git clone https://github.com/psychoinformatics-de/ipsy-docs.git
    cd ipsy-docs
    git submodule update --init --recursive

* setup and activate a `virtualenv </tools/python/#virtual-environments>`_::

    python3 -m venv ~/.venvs/pelican
    source ~/.venvs/pelican/bin/activate

* install Pelican and dependencies::

    pip3 install pelican beautifulsoup4

* run the development server::

    make devserver

* point your browser to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``.

Your copy of the docs will be served locally at that address, and any changes
will automatically trigger a rebuild.

If you are not familiar with the process of ``git add -p``, ``git commit``, and
``git push``, then now is a good reminder for you to read the
`git documentation </tools/git/>`_ in order to push your changes.
